Installation and Configuration Steps:
-------------------------------------
- Install TinyOS v.2.2 on Laptop#1 and Laptop#2

- Install Contiki and Cooja on Laptop #2

- Install Eclipse and Java on laptop#1 and laptop#2 (and laptop#3 to run DB_Server: optional, you can use laptop#2 to run DB_Server in parallel with Tablet2)

- Install Android Studio on any laptop

- Unzip OVM_ThirdGeneration

- Import OVM_Java_PC into Eclipse in both laptops: copy the folder into workspace then open eclipse and then file->import->existing projects into workspace

- After installing TinyOS v.2.2, Copy the folder Oppnet2 which is under: OVM_ThirdGeneration/OVM_NesC_Lites/OVM_Primitives_NesC_Lites
and paste it under /opt/tinyos-2.x/apps/tests

- Start Cooja: open the terminal: go the folder where cooja is and write this command: sudo ant run

- Inside Cooja: click on File->Open simulation ->Open and reconfigure the Cooja_Emulation.csc. follow the reconfiguration wizard:
 For SkyMote# 1 and SkyMote# 2 install : OVM_ThirdGeneration/OVM_NesC_Lites/MicroOppnet_v5_NesC_Lites/Lites_BaseStation_Main/main.sky
 For the other SkyMotes (i.e 3-6) install : OVM_ThirdGeneration/OVM_NesC_Lites/MicroOppnet_v5_NesC_Lites/Lites_Mote_Zigbee_Main/main.sky

- To install the android OVM do the following: OVM_ThirdGeneration/OVM_Android_Phone/Smartphone_Main has the ConnectTest.apk file that should be installed on the android phone.
