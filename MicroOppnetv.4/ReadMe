1. Compile the following files in their environments (under tinyOS) by following the compilation steps of a telosb mica in the tinyOS tutorial:
- BaseStation
- Edited_BaseStation
- TestSerial_Sender
- TestSerial_Receiver

2. Take the exe files under BaseStation/build/telosb and Edited_BaseStation/build/telosb and change them to other names with extension .sky instead of .exe

3. To Start Cooja do the following:
- open termenial and go to Contiki/tools/Cooja/sudo ant run
- it might fail to open, try to install ant and run the command again
- when it opens do the following:
(a) file -> new simulation
(b) motes -> add motes -> create new mote type -> sky mote (add 2 motes and insatall on them BaseStation.sky)
(c) motes -> add motes -> create new mote type -> sky mote (add 3 motes and insatall on them Edited_BaseStation.sky)
(d) now right click on the the first mote (with BaseStation.sky installed on it) and click on mote tools for sky1 -->serial socket (server) it will open a socket listening on port 60001
(e) right click on the the second mote (with BaseStation.sky installed on it) and click on mote tools for sky2 -->serial socket (server) it will open a socket listening on port 60002


4. open a new terminal (terminal1) tab and go to mai@ubuntu:/opt/tinyos-2.x/apps/tests/TestSerial_Sender$ 
5. Open another terminal (terminal2) tab and go to mai@ubuntu:/opt/tinyos-2.x/apps/tests/TestSerial_Receiver$
6. now start the simulation (make sure that the motes are at the correct distances)
7. on terminal 2 run the following command: java TestSerial -comm network@localhost:60002
8. on terminal 1 run the following command: java TestSerial -comm network@localhost:60001


9. terminal 1 will output: sending packet 911

10. terminal 2 will output: receiving packet 911  Done
